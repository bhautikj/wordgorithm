Wordgorithm
=========

A collection of python NLP routines for computational humor. The entire goal is to automate generation of lowbrow humour. At this stage, it's just absurdist (playing with the sounds of words only)- integration with a context engine is needed to make the jokes more meaningful.

Usage
--------------

```
>>> import jokegenA
>>> print jokegenA.jokegenA()
What do you call a akin tin?
A kin can!

>>> print haiku.genHaikuA()
naturalize milestone -
treasure accent easterly
confined chardonnay

>>> print limerick.genLimerickA()
There was once a straitjacket named genet
Who found a hormone in the senate
They said, 'Now, by surround
It's a dangerous compound!
I declare this a thorough signet!'

>>> print limerick.genLimerickB()
There was a hippo so billion
Unaware he was million;
He would go to a napkin
And attest just as pumpkin,
Just like a capo zillion.
```
